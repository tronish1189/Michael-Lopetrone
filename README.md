## Dev Ops

First, initialize a new NPM project by running `npm init`.

After that, to install project dependencies, run `npm install`. This will install Bootstrap, Gulp, and other project dependencies.

Once all dependencies are installed, run `gulp` to start tasks (SASS compiling, JS Babel, BrowserSync, etc).
